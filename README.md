# Image Captioning with Deep Learning
> Leveraging CNN-RNN architectures to generate descriptive captions for images.

This project demonstrates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to create a sophisticated image captioning system. By combining these models, we can interpret the content of images and generate relevant textual descriptions, showcasing the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing.

### Dataset
Utilizes the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset, a benchmark for evaluating scene understanding and image captioning algorithms. More information can be found on the [MS COCO website](http://cocodataset.org/#home) and in the [comprehensive research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.0312.pdf).

### Encoder-Decoder Architecture
- **Encoder**: Employs a pre-trained ResNet-50 model to extract features from images. The model's architecture allows for a deep understanding of visual content, essential for accurate caption generation.
